# Quantum-Information
This repository is dedicated to Quantum Information Science (QIS), featuring simulations, code, and implementations related to quantum computing, quantum channels, and other QIS-related topics. It serves as a collection of my research, experiments, and projects in quantum information theory, providing resources for future work and exploration.
## Quantum Channel Simulations
This notebook simulates quantum channels using quantum gates and density matrices. It includes visualization tools to represent transformations in 3D space.

### Features
- Implements single-qubit quantum gates (X Y and Z Gates, Pauli matrices, Hadamard, Phase, T-gate, and rotation gates).
- Generates density matrices for pure and mixed states.
- Provides an interactive 3D visualization of quantum state transformations using Plotly.
- Simulates random quantum states and their evolution through quantum channels.
